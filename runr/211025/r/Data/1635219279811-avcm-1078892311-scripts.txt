#We create a population of voters of size n, where p% are in support and q=(1-p)% are against #some issue.  We want to take k samples of size s(surveys of size s) and then 
#look at a frequency histograms of our sample means and a density(i.e. probability) histogram #for our sample z-scores. For each sample, the sample mean is taken as the proportion of #voters  that support the issue.
 #In our population 1="Support" and 0="Against".
